# Nydas Dactyl
This is very much a work in progress. At this stage I have not tried to print the 3D model. Buyer beware! (don't worry - it's free)

I'm building this not as a opportunity to dive into the custom keyboard business, but simply because I wanted a challenge and I wanted a keyboard that was truly mine.

The keyboard is a split, 36 key ortho layout with a fairly aggressive stagger and a splay that mimics my fingers. I've been using a custom keyboard with the same stagger and splay, but as a 2D design for a little over 6 months now, and I figured it was time to take it to the next level.

The keyboard is designed to accommodate the Nydas Amoeba per-key PCB which also exists within the repo. It's being designed in OpenSCAD. Both the OpenSCAD files as well as an STL are available in the repo.

A few things... This is an active development project, and in my mind it's not ready to print yet. The aim is to add a trackball to the right half in place of the rotary coder and OLED (which will remain on the left half only). I need to do some work on the underside of the switch holder, as the Amoebas I've designed have little holes in each corner and I would like posts on the case that fit into these for stability.

I'm planning to use the BlackPill controller, and when I get it programmed will create a new folder in this repo with the code to make it all work (but note that I use a modified Dvorak layout, so I'm imagining it would need some tweaking by anyone choosing to use it).

## Pictures
I'll try to keep these up to date as the design changes / more is added.
This is the front. The aim is to keep it low, but also add in a fixed tenting that works for me.

And this is the view from the thumb cluster.

I'm not 100% sure about this right now, but I guess printing it and trying it out will tell me. Keyboards like the [Skeletyl](https://bastardkb.com/skeletyl/) curve the thumb keys the other way to the fingers (so the middle key is highest rather than lowest). I'm assuming this has been done for a good reason, and I'll waste a print finding out the hard way, but it makes sense to me that my thumb rolls the same way as my other fingers.
