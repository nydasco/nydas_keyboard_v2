# Nydas Keyboard

This repo currently contains two primary folders:

1. NydasAmoeba - this contains both the KiCad files and the Gerber for a per-key RGB choc PCB
2. NydasDactyl - this contains (very much WIP) OpenSCD and stl files for a 3D case

A third folder will be created in the future that holds the code to flash onto a keyboard controller to make this whole thing work.

This is a personal project that I will be completing over a number of months, I'm in no great rush to get it completed, so please don't pin your hopes on getting a completed 'ready to go' version of this any time soon unless you want to finish it off yourself.
